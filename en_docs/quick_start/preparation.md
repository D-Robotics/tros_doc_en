# 1.1 Environment Setup

TogetheROS.Bot supports installation on the Horizon RDK and X86 platforms with Ubuntu 20.04 system. Installing through DEB packages on Ubuntu system is simple and recommended for users who want to experience it initially.

Next, we will introduce the environment setup details for Horizon RDK and X86 platforms respectively.

## Horizon RDK Platform

### System Installation

Before installing tros.b, it is recommended to upgrade the Horizon RDK system image to the latest version. Here is the method of burning Ubuntu 20.04 image: [Ubuntu Image Burning Method](https://developer.horizon.cc/documents_rdk/installation/install_os)

If the image has already been installed, you can upgrade it by running the commands `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`.

**Note:**

- **If you have installed the 1.x version of the system, you need to upgrade it to the 2.x version.**

- **For the method of checking the system version number and detailed instructions, please refer to the [FAQs](../FAQs/hardware_and_system.md).**

### System Configuration

After successfully burning the image, you need to configure the IP address of the Horizon RDK for daily use. The login username is "root" and the password is "root".

:::caution **Note**
To facilitate the smooth installation and use of tros.b later, please log in with the **root** account.
:::

In the experience and development process, it is often necessary to access the Horizon RDK through commands such as scp/ssh using the IP address. Therefore, it is recommended to use dynamic configuration, as described in [Network Configuration](https://developer.horizon.cc/documents_rdk/configuration/network).

Try to ping Baidu server:

```shell

```The normal return of the "ping" command indicates that both internet access and DNS configuration are correct.

Upgrade the system image and source information: `sudo apt update` `sudo apt upgrade`

Test SSH: `ssh root@Horizon RDK IP address`. Here, the Horizon RDK IP address is 10.64.61.228, so enter `ssh root@10.64.61.228`. There will be the following prompt for the first SSH login:

```shell
 ssh root@10.64.61.241
The authenticity of host '10.64.61.241 (10.64.61.241)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:5NQuzIkfNYZftPkxrzCugbQs5Gy5CEC5U3Nhtu+sJs8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
```

Enter `yes` and press Enter, then enter the password: root, to access Horizon RDK normally.

```dotnetcli
ssh root@10.64.61.241
The authenticity of host '10.64.61.241 (10.64.61.241)' can't be established.

## X86 Platform

Install Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit system on a physical machine using X86 platform and configure the network environment. You can also use virtual machine or Docker, but the running efficiency may be lower.
