# 4.1 SLAM Mapping

## Function Introduction

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technique used to simultaneously estimate the location of a robot and create a map of its environment. In this chapter, we will use ROS2 SLAM-Toolbox to perform mapping on a simulated car in Gazebo, and observe the mapping results through Rviz2. The SLAM-Toolbox runs on the Horizon RDK, while Gazebo and Rviz2 run on a PC in the same network as the Horizon RDK.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Execution Method | Example Functionality |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| RDK X3, RDK X3 Module, RDK Ultra| Ubuntu 20.04 | Start the simulation environment on the PC and perform SLAM mapping on the Horizon RDK, finally display the mapping results using Rviz2. |

## Prerequisites

### Horizon RDK Platform

1. The Horizon RDK has been flashed with the Ubuntu 20.04 image provided by Horizon.

2. TogetheROS.Bot has been successfully installed on the Horizon RDK.

3. After the successful installation of tros.b, install the SLAM-Toolbox:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-slam-toolbox
    ```

4. The PC, which is in the same network as the Horizon RDK, has been installed with Ubuntu 20.04, ROS2 Foxy Desktop version, Gazebo simulation environment, and the data visualization tool Rviz2.

    Installation documentation for ROS2 Foxy: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html

    After successful installation of ROS2 on the PC, install the Gazebo and Turtlebot3 related packages as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-gazebo-*
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3-bringup
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3-simulations
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-teleop-twist-keyboard
    ```

## User Guide

### Horizon RDK PlatformThis section introduces how to use Horizon RDK to run SLAM algorithm and observe mapping effect using PC.

Start the simulation environment on the PC:

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

The simulation environment is shown in the figure below:

Open another console on the PC and start Rviz2 to observe the mapping effect:

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup rviz2.launch.py
```

After opening Rviz2, the "map" visualization option needs to be added to display the built map. The steps are as follows:

Run SLAM-Toolbox on the Horizon RDK board:

```bash
# Configure tros.b environment
source /opt/tros/setup.bash

# Start the SLAM launch file
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_sync_launch.py
```

Open another console on the PC and start the control tool to control the movement of the robot car with the keyboard. The control method can be found in the log printed on the console:

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

Control the robot car to move. As the robot car detects more environmental information with the radar, the SLAM algorithm also builds the environmental map, which can be observed in Rviz2.
